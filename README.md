For the web scraping part:
Almost definitely, your chrome version should be something like 141.0.(something)
If it is some other version then go to this link and download the appropriate file: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads/version-selection
If it is this version then go to this link: https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/
Once you are on the page it is pretty self explanatory. just download the stable version of the chromedriver (NOT the chrome). make sure you know exactly where you download it as the path to it has to be input in the scrapeGradescope.py file. 
Once you have downloaded the driver, go to line 11 in the python file and add your path there. 
once you have done these steps you should be able to run the python file from the run button at the top right corner of your screen. 
click on the drop down next to the run button at the top and choose the 'run python file' option specifically because sometimes vsc chooses to "run code" instead and that will not result in the same thing
